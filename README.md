This repository holds the latest notebook versions as HTML documents.
These each have a table of contents
and are quicker to view
than waiting for GitHub to render the .ipyng notebooks.

The index.html file was generated with the following command
executed from the root directory.

```
tree notebooks -H 'notebooks' -T 'Jupyter notebooks for workshops-dc-py' --charset utf-8 --noreport > index.html
