    "computing is about humans communicating with the computer\n",
    "to modulate flows of current in the hardware,\n",
    "in order to get the computer to carry out advanced calculations\n",
    "that we are unable to efficiently compute ourselves.\n",
    "Early examples of human-computer communication was quite primitive\n",
    "and included actually disconnecting a wire and connecting it again in a different spot.\n",
    "Luckily,\n",
    "we are not doing this anymore.\n",
    "Instead,\n",
    "we have graphical user interfaces with menus and buttons,\n",
    "which is what you are commonly using on your laptop.\n",
    "These graphical interfaces can be thought of as a layer (or shell)\n",
    "around the internal components of your operating system.\n",
    "They exist as a middle man,\n",
    "making it easier for us to express our thoughts,\n",
    "and for computers to interpret them.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of programs with as graphical interface are spreadsheet software,\n",
    "such as Microsoft Excel and LibreOffice Calc.\n",
    "In these programs,\n",
    "all the functionality is accessible via hierarchical menus,\n",

    "Well,\n",
    "graphical user interfaces can be nice when you are new to something,\n",
    "but text based interfaces are more powerful, faster,\n",
    "and actually easier to use once you get comfortable with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can compare it to learning a language:\n",
    "in the beginning it's convenient to look up words in a dictionary\n",
    "(the analog of a menu in a graphical interface),\n",
    "to slowly string together sentences one word at a time.\n",
    "But,\n",
    "once we become more proficient in the language and know what we want to say,\n",
    "it is easier to say or type it directly,\n",
    "instead of having to look up every word in the dictionary first.\n",
    "Likewise,\n",
    "experienced programmers can work faster and with more flow\n",
    "when they can type directly to the computer,\n",
    "instead of being constrained by graphical menus.\n",
    "It would be even faster to have the computer interpret speech or even thought,\n",
    "via speech- and brain-computer interfaces,\n",
    "but accuracy is often a limiting factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "A critical advantage of text interfaces,\n",
    "is the ease of task automation and repetition.\n",
    "Once you have all the instructions written down,\n",
    "it is simple to apply them to a different dataset.\n",
    "This facilitates reproducibility of analysis,\n",
    "not only between teams from different organizations,\n",
    "but also between individuals on the same team.\n",
    "Compare being shown how to perform a certain analysis in spreadsheet software,\n",
    "where the instructions will be\n",
    "\"first you click here, then here, then here...\",\n",
    "with being handed the same workflow written down in several lines of codes,\n",
    "which you can analyze and understand at your own pace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another advantage of text interfaces,\n",
    "is that they are less resource intensive than their graphical counterparts\n",
    "and easier to develop programs with text interfaces\n",
    "since you don't have to code the graphical components.\n",
    "This frees up developers to spend their time on other valuable components of the software.\n",
    "The ease of implementation\n",
    "combined with the efficiency of use for experienced users,\n",
    "results in that that many powerful programs are written without a graphical user interface.\n",
    "To use these programs,\n",
    "you need to know how to interact via text.\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "many the best data analysis and machine learning packages are written in Python or R,\n",
    "and you need to know these languages to use the machine learning components.\n",
    "Even if the program or package you want to use is not written in one of these languages,\n",
    "much of the knowledge you gain from understanding one programming language can be transferred to others.\n",
    "In addition,\n",
